# Text Classification on news data with traditional ML Methods



### Tools

keras
sklearn

# Methods 

1. CNN 、 CNN + word2vec
2. LSTM 、 LSTM + word2vec
3. DNN
4. Naive Bayes
5. KNN
6. SVM
7. SVM + word2vec 、SVM + doc2vec



### Dataset

### Outcomes

1. Pre-trained Word2vec can get serious improvement on the task
2. LSTM is usually longer than CNN though the parameters' amount of LSTM is way less than CNN
3. LSTM m
4. sum average of word2vec representation of each words in a sentence to denote the sentence seems an Ok method for short text

### Further

1. fasttext as classifier
2. Biger dataset size, longer text doc.
3. recently - proposed methods
